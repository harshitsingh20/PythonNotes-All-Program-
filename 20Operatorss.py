#Operators in Python
#1)Arithmetic Operators:-(+,-,/,%(Remainder),*,//(It does not give decimal value),**(power))
#2)Assignment Operators:-(=,+=,-=,/=,%=)
#3)Comparision Operators:-(==,!=,>=,<=)
#4)Logical Operators:-(and(If both have true),or(if both have different value))
#5)Identity Operators:(is(If both have true),is not(if both have different value))
#6)Membership Operators:-(in,not in)
#7)Bitwise operators:-(&(and),|(or))

# Arithmetic Operators
# print("5 + 6 is ", 5+6)
# print("5 - 6 is ", 5-6)
# print("5 * 6 is ", 5*6)
# print("5 / 6 is ", 5/6)
# print("5 ** 3 is ", 5**3)
# print("5 % 5 is ", 5%5)
# print("15 // 6 is ", 15//6)

# Assignment Operators
# print("Assignment Operators")
# x = 5
# print(x)
# x %=7 # x = x%7
# print(x)

# Comparison Operators
# i == 5


# Logical Operators
# a = True
# b = False

# Identity Operators
# print(5 is not 5)

# Membership Operators
# list = [3, 3,2, 2,39, 33, 35,32]
# print(324 not in list)

# Bitwise Operators
# 0 - 00
# 1 - 01
# 2 - 10
# 3 - 11

print(0 & 2)
print(0 | 3)
