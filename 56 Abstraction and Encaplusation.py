# Abstraction:-  refers to hiding the unnecessary details so that the focus could be on the whole product instead
# of parts of the project separately. Splits into small pices

# Let us take the example of a car:- It has an engine, tires, windows, steering wheel, etc. All these things combine to
# forming a car, which is an abstraction, and all the different parts are its layers of abstraction. Now an engine is
# composed of different parts such as camshaft, valves, oil pan, etc. these flayers the engine is an abstraction. In
# simple words, abstraction can be achieved by hiding the background details and showing only the necessary ones. In
# programming, abstraction can not be achieved without Encapsulation.

# Encapsulation:-  means hiding under layers. When working with classes and handling sensitive data, global access to
# all the variables used in the program is not secure. Hide the detail of the implementation.
